# loan_quality_predictor


Goal: Build a loan quality predictor

Conduct analysis on the data and uncover insights about the loansâ€™ performance:

implement one or more algorithms to predict whether a loan will be good or bad
assess the performance of your algorithms, using statistics or charts as necessary

Good loans are the ones where the status is current or fully paid. 

Bad loans are the ones where the status is default, in grace period, or late.

This model was coded and tested using Python.
